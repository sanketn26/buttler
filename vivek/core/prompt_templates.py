## User Request
{user_input}

## Understanding Framework

### 1. Core Intent Analysis
What is the user fundamentally trying to achieve?
- Primary goal:
- Key requirements:
- Success criteria:

### 2. Scope Definition
What boundaries should we establish?
**In Scope:**
- Core functionality requested
- Essential supporting features
- Basic error handling and validation

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced features not mentioned
- Future enhancements
- Non-essential optimizations

### 3. Assumptions & Prerequisites
What must be true for this to work?
- Technical assumptions:
- Required dependencies:
- Existing constraints:

### 4. Success Metrics
How will we know this is complete?
- Functional requirements:
- Quality standards:
- Performance expectations:

## Critical Thinking Questions
1. Is the request clear and unambiguous?
2. Are there implicit requirements not stated?
3. What could go wrong with this approach?
4. How might this evolve in the future?

## Understanding Summary

## Decomposition Framework

### Activity Identification Strategy
Break down the request into 3-5 high-level activities that:
- Represent logical units of work
- Can be completed independently (when possible)
- Follow natural development workflow
- Have clear start/end points

### Activity Structure
For each activity, define:
- **Name**: Clear, actionable title
- **Description**: What work needs to be done
- **Expected Outcomes**: Measurable results
- **Dependencies**: What must come first
- **Boundaries**: What is/isn't included

## Multiple Perspectives Analysis
Analyze each activity from six critical perspectives:

### üë§ USER Perspective
- How does this activity impact user experience?
- Is the user flow intuitive and efficient?
- What usability considerations exist?

### üß≠ CRITIC Perspective
- What are the weaknesses or risks?
- What could go wrong?
- What are the trade-offs?

### üß∞ OPS/DevOps Perspective
- How deployable and maintainable is this?
- What monitoring/logging is needed?
- How will this scale?

### üêû DEBUGGER Perspective
- How easy will this be to troubleshoot?
- What debugging information should be included?
- How will errors be surfaced and diagnosed?

### üöÄ FUTURE Perspective
- How will this adapt to future needs?
- What extension points are needed?
- How will this scale?

### ü§ù SDET (Testing) Perspective
- How testable is this approach?
- What edge cases need coverage?
- How will quality be validated?

## Activity to Taskify
{activity_to_taskify}

## Task Creation Framework

### Test-Driven Development Pattern
For each activity, create tasks following Red-Green-Refactor:

1. **RED**: Write failing test
   - Define expected behavior
   - Create test structure
   - Verify test fails appropriately

2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal solution
   - Write just enough code to pass test
   - Focus on functionality first
   - Verify test passes

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve implementation
   - Enhance code quality
   - Add documentation
   - Optimize performance
   - Verify all tests still pass

### Task Structure
Each task should be:
- **Atomic**: Single responsibility
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies
- **Estimable**: Clear scope

### File Organization Strategy
- **Test files**: `tests/test_[feature].py`
- **Implementation files**: `src/[feature].py`
- **Configuration files**: `config/[feature].yml`
- **Documentation files**: `docs/[feature].md`
